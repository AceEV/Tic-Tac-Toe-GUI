# Tic-Tac-Toe-GUI

Improvement on the previous non-GUI version on Tic-Tac-Toe.

This is a very basic working Model of Tic Tac Toe using GUI.

The whole program is coded in Python3. The only additional library required is Tkinter for the GUI.
You can install Tkinter with 'pip install Tkinter' in the terminal.

It uses the same helper.py file from the previous project, slightly modified the input parameter.

To run, make sure you have Tkinter installed and run 'main.py' using Python3

Have fun playing!
